                <main>History of <span style="font-style: italic">Canis lupus familiaris</span>, the domestic Dog.
                    <p>The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered
                         a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) 
                         is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, 
                          and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf 
                          are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first 
                          domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.  
                          The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over                           
                          millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
                    </p>       
                        Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior 
                        and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other 
                        canid species. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors.  
                        They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, 
                        assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people 
                        and therapeutic roles. 
                        This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".
